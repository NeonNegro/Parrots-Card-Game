- When the game starts, a timer will start, showing how long you've been playing
- Choose by clicking two cards
- When choosing the second card visual and sound cues will indicate whether or not you got it rigth
- After turning all the cards in the rigth order, a prompt will:
  - Show how much time you took to fish the game;
